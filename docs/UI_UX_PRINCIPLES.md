# UI/UX principles

## Put context where the user is looking

**Principle:** Any message, note, or clarifying detail should live **where the user’s focus is**, not somewhere else on the page.

- **Example:** If the user is looking at a “Landed cost” column, the fact that values are in USD should be in **that column’s heading** (e.g. “Landed cost (USD)”), not in a separate note above or below the table.
- **Why:** Users scan by column or field. A note elsewhere is easy to miss; a label in the heading is seen in context.
- **Apply to:** Table headers, form labels, input placeholders, and section titles. Prefer inline context (e.g. “Price (GBP)”, “Quantity (units)”) over standalone notes when possible.
